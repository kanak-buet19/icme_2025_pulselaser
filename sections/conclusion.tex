    \begin{block}{Key Findings}
        \footnotesize
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Established frequency-dependent relationship: cooling rate and grain refinement inversely correlate with pulsing frequency (2–50 kHz)
            \item Higher frequencies yield finer columnar grains ($\approx 8.2$ µm)
            \item Lower frequencies produce coarser grains ($\approx 9.7$ µm)
            \item Peak Z-axis misorientation observed at 8 kHz, diminishing at higher frequencies
        \end{itemize}
